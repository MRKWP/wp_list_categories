# Dynamic Block for access to WP List Categories
A block for Displaying a list of categories inside WordPress.

This is a direct extraction of the wp_list_categories() function.

I use this in sidebars for custom post types and custom taxonomies.

The block is just a simple started and is useful for anyone wanting a dynamic block.
